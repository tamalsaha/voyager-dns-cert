# Issue Let's Encrypt certificate using AWS Route53

This tutorial shows how to issue free SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt via DNS challenge for domains using Route53 DNS service.

This article has been tested with a kops managed Kubernetes cluster on AWS.

```console
$ kops version
Version 1.7.1 (git-c69b811)

$ kubectl version --short
Client Version: v1.8.3
Server Version: v1.7.10
```

## Deploy Voyager operator

Deploy Voyager operator following instructions here: https://github.com/appscode/voyager/blob/master/docs/install.md

```console
# install without RBAC
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appscode/voyager/5.0.0-rc.4/hack/deploy/voyager.sh \
  | bash -s -- aws

# run on master
kubectl patch deploy voyager-operator -n kube-system \
  --patch "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appscode/voyager/5.0.0-rc.4/hack/deploy/run-on-master.yaml)"
```

If you are trying this on a RBAC enabled cluster, pass the flag `--rbac` to installer script.

```console
# install without RBAC
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appscode/voyager/5.0.0-rc.4/hack/deploy/voyager.sh \
  | bash -s -- aws --rbac
```

## Setup Route53 Hosted Zone

In this tutorial, I am going to use `kiteci.pro` domain that was purchased on namecheap.com . Now, go to your AWS Route53 console and create a hosted zone for this domain.

![create-hosted-zone](/create-hosted-zone.png)

Once the hosted zone is created, you can see the list of name servers in AWS console.

![ns-servers](/ns-servers.png)

Now, go to the website of your domain registrar and update the list of name servers.

![domain-registrar](/domain-registrar.png)

Give time to propagate the updated DNS records. You can use the following command to confirm that the name server records has been updated.

```console
$ dig -t ns kiteci.pro

; <<>> DiG 9.10.3-P4-Ubuntu <<>> -t ns kiteci.pro

## Configure IAM Permissions

To issue SSL certificate using Let's Encrypt, we have to prove that we own the `kiteci.pro` domain. The following AWS IAM policy document describes the permissions required for voyager operator to complete the DNS challenge. Replace <INSERT_YOUR_HOSTED_ZONE_ID_HERE> with the Route 53 zone ID of the domain you are authorizing.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "route53:GetChange",
                "route53:ListHostedZonesByName"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "route53:ChangeResourceRecordSets"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:route53:::hostedzone/<INSERT_YOUR_HOSTED_ZONE_ID_HERE>"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

There are few different ways to grant these permissions to voyager operator pods.

### option #1: Using Instance IAM Role

When kops creates a cluster, it creates 2 IAM roles: one for the master and one for the nodes. You can grant these additional IAM permissions to the appropriate instance IAM role.

Here, we are running voyager operator pod on master node. So, we will grant these permissions to the role assigned to the master instance. To do this, take the following steps:

- Go to your EC2 dashboard and identify the IAM role for your master instance.

![master-iam-role](/master-iam-role.png)

- Go the [IAM roles console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/roles) and select the master IAM role for your cluster.

![master-role](/master-iam-role-console.png)

- Now add the custom inline policy show above.

![add-policy](/add-policy.png)


**NB:** _If you decide to run voyager operator on regular nodes, then you can grant these additional IAM permissions to the node IAM role for your cluster. Please note that this will allow any pods running on the nodes to perform these api calls._

### option #2: Create IAM User

If you are running cluster on cloud providers other than AWS but want to use Route53 as your DNS provider, this is your only option. You can also use this method for clusters running on AWS.

Here we will create a new IAM role called `voyager` and grant it the necessary permissions. Then we wil issue an access key pair for this IAM role and pass this to voyager using a Kubernetes secret.

```console
aws iam create-user --user-name voyager
aws iam put-user-policy --user-name voyager --policy-name voyager --policy-document file://$PWD/voyager-policy.json
aws iam create-access-key --user-name voyager

kubectl create secret generic voyager-route53 --namespace default \
  --from-literal=AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=INSERT_YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID_HERE \
  --from-literal=AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=INSERT_YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_HERE \
  --from-literal=AWS_HOSTED_ZONE_ID=INSERT_YOUR_HOSTED_ZONE_ID_HERE

kubectl get secret voyager-route53 -o yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: SU5TRVJUX1lPVVJfQUNDRVNTX0tFWV9JRF9IRVJF
  AWS_HOSTED_ZONE_ID: SU5TRVJUX1lPVVJfSE9TVEVEX1pPTkVfSURfSEVSRQ==
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: SU5TRVJUX1lPVVJfU0VDUkVUX0FDQ0VTU19LRVlfSEVSRQ==
kind: Secret
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: 2017-11-27T23:17:31Z
  name: voyager-route53
  namespace: default
  resourceVersion: "16160"
  selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/default/secrets/voyager-route53
  uid: 24949869-d3c9-11e7-98b3-08002787a1b5
type: Opaque
```

**NB**:

- Please make sure that you have updated the voyager-policy.json file to use the hosted zone id for your domain.
- The _`file://` prefix is required_, otherwise you will get an error like `An error occurred (MalformedPolicyDocument) when calling the PutUserPolicy operation: Syntax errors in policy.`
- The Kubernetes secret must be created in the same namespace where the `Certificate` object exists.
- `AWS_HOSTED_ZONE_ID` key is optional and will be automatically detected from DNS records, if not found in secret. If you are trying to issue a SANS certificate with multiple top level domains, do not set `AWS_HOSTED_ZONE_ID` in the secret.

## Create Certificate

Create a secret to provide ACME user email. Change the email to a valid email address and run the following command:

```console
kubectl create secret generic acme-account --from-literal=ACME_EMAIL=me@example.com
```

Create the Certificate CRD to issue TLS certificate from Let's Encrypt using DNS challenge.

```console
kubectl apply -f crt.yaml

apiVersion: voyager.appscode.com/v1beta1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: kitecipro
  namespace: default
spec:
  domains:
  - kiteci.pro
  - www.kiteci.pro
  acmeUserSecretName: acme-account
  challengeProvider:
    dns:
      provider: route53
```

Now, voyager will perform domain validation by setting a TXT record for each domain by prepending the label `_acme-challenge`to the domain name being validated in this certificate using IAM role assigned to master instance. This TXT record will be removed after validation is complete. Once you successfully complete the challenges for a domain, the resulting authorization is cached for your account to use again later. Cached authorizations last for 30 days from the time of validation. If the certificate you requested has all of the necessary authorizations cached then validation will not happen again until the relevant cached authorizations expire.

![acme-challenge](/acme-challenge.png)

After several minutes, you should see a new secret named `tls-kitecipro`. This contains the `tls.crt` and `tls.key` .

```console
$ kubectl get secrets
NAME                  TYPE                                  DATA      AGE

```

**NB**

- By default, voyager will store the issued SSL certificates in a secret named as `tls-<certificate-name>`. If you want to store the issued certificates in a different secret, you can provide that in that in the `spec.storage.secret.name` field in the `Certificate` object.

```console
$ cat crt-secret-store.yaml

apiVersion: voyager.appscode.com/v1beta1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: kitecipro
  namespace: default
spec:
  domains:
  - kiteci.pro
  - www.kiteci.pro
  acmeUserSecretName: acme-account
  challengeProvider:
    dns:
      provider: route53
  storage:
    secret:
      name: cert-kitecipro
```

- If you created an IAM user for voyager, you can pass it by setting `spec.challengeProvider.dns.credentialSecretName` field.

```console
$ cat crt-dns-credential.yaml

apiVersion: voyager.appscode.com/v1beta1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: kitecipro-iam
  namespace: default
spec:
  domains:
  - kiteci.pro
  - www.kiteci.pro
  acmeUserSecretName: acme-account
  challengeProvider:
    dns:
      provider: route53
      credentialSecretName: voyager-route53
  storage:
    secret:
      name: cert-kitecipro
```

## Configure Ingress

We are going to use two separate services as backend. Run the following commands to deploy backends:

```console
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx
kubectl expose deployment nginx --name=web --port=80 --target-port=80

kubectl run echoserver --image=gcr.io/google_containers/echoserver:1.4
kubectl expose deployment echoserver --name=echo --port=80 --target-port=8080
```

Now create Ingress `ing-tls.yaml`

```console
kubectl apply -f ing-tls.yaml

apiVersion: voyager.appscode.com/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: test-ingress
  namespace: default
  annotations:
    ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
spec:
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - www.kiteci.pro
    ref:
      kind: Certificate
      name: kitecipro
  rules:
  - host: www.kiteci.pro
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /web
        backend:
          serviceName: web
          servicePort: 80
      - path: /
        backend:
          serviceName: echo
          servicePort: 80
```

Wait for the LoadBlanacer CNAME to be assigned. Once the CNAME is assigned, set the LoadBlancer hostname as the CNAME record for test domain `www.kiteci.pro`

```console
$ kubectl get svc voyager-test-ingress -o wide
NAME                   TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP                                                               PORT(S)                      AGE       SELECTOR
voyager-test-ingress   LoadBalancer   100.67.213.242   a65b35533d3d211e78b0402cf95c35e1-1933171379.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com   443:31708/TCP,80:31905/TCP   36s       origin-api-group=voyager.appscode.com,origin-name=test-ingress,origin=voyager
```

![cname-record](/cname-record.png)

Now wait a bit for DNs to propagate. Run the following command to confirm DNS propagation.

```console
$ dig -t cname +short www.kiteci.pro
a65b35533d3d211e78b0402cf95c35e1-1933171379.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com.
```

Now open URL https://www.kiteci.pro/web . This should show you the familiar nginx welcome page. If you visit https://www.kiteci.pro , it will echo your connection info.


## FAQ: Let's Encrypt

### How do I renew my LE certificates?
LE issues certificates that are valid for 90 days. Voyager operator will try renewing your certificate 7 days prior to expiration. Once renewed certificates are issued, HAProxy will be automatically updated to use the new certificates.

### I think I did everything according to this doc but my certificate is not issuing? How do I debug?
To debug, describe the certificate object and check the events listed under it. Voyager will report any warning events under the certificate object.

```console
kubectl describe certificate <name> --namespace <namespace>
```

You can also check the logs for voyager operator pod and look for anything suspicious.
```console
kubectl logs -f <voyager-pod-name> -n kube-system
```

### What are the rate limits for Let's Encrypt?
Please consult the official document on this matter: https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/

### How to use Let's Encrypt staging servers?
If you are just testing Voyager and want to avoid hitting the rate limits in LE productoion environment, you have 2 options:
- Buy a cheap domain for testing. There are lot of $0.99/yr domains available these days.
- You can tell voyager to use the LE staging servers for issuing the certificate. The issued certificate is not trusted, hence should not be used in production websites. But this works great for testing purposes. To use the staging environment, set the key `ACME_SERVER_URL` in your acme secret in addition to your email address.

```console
kubectl create secret generic acme-account \
  --from-literal=ACME_EMAIL=me@example.com \
  --from-literal=ACME_SERVER_URL=https://acme-staging.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
```

### Where is my LE account info?
Given your acme email and acme server url (if provided), voyager operator will open a new LE account. Voyager will store the account data in the acme user secret under `ACME_USER_PRIVATE_KEY` and `ACME_REGISTRATION_DATA` keys after the first successful registration. Any following interaction will LE will done using this account. This helps voyager to avoid performing repeated domain ownership challenged. We recommend that you keep a backup copy of the full secret. To be clear, if these keys are missing voyager will automatically register a new account with LE and use that.

```console
$ kubectl get secrets acme-account -o yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  ACME_EMAIL: dGFt29t
  ACME_REGISTRATION_DATA: eyJib2R5Ijp7InJlc291cmNlIjoicmVnIiwiaWQiOjI0OTc1NTYwLCJrZXkiOnsia3R5IjoiUlNBIiwibiI6IjNXRDRzY0hsUUN6N1JmbUZUNmZ3YXpIZ2UyNjhsajk5UGJmMkNwV1lSRzhlTFNHVGVBd0ZXdFVmRTRyMnItQkdjT3AtTnFtYUxBWGxGQmZTWjhtNzRnNEhPbHdPR0tYaTg1cG5hRkYxZS12MDEuYXBpLmxldHNlbmNyeXB0Lm9yZy9hY21lL25ldy1hdXRoeiIsInRlcm1zX29mX3NlcnZpY2UiOiJodHRwczovL2xldHNlbmNyeXB0Lm9yZy9kb2N1bWVudHMvTEUtU0EtdjEuMi1Ob3ZlbWJlci0xNS0yMDE3LnBkZiJ9

### How can I distribute the issued ssl certificates?
There are several options:
- If you are trying to distribute the same ssl certificate across different namespaces of a cluster, you can use a tool like [kubed](https://github.com/appscode/kubed/blob/master/docs/tutorials/config-syncer.md).
- If you want to distribute the issued certificates across different clusters, you can setup Voyager to issue certificates independently on each cluster. Please read the rate limiting restrictions for LE. The other option is to use [Kubernetes cluster federation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-federation/secret/) but it might not be worth the trouble if this is your only usecase for cluster federation.
- Just manually copy paste the `tls-***` secret to your destination cluster or namespace.


### How to issue certificate with multiple domains?
The above example shows how to issue a SANS certificate with multiple domains. The only restriction is that all domains must be using the same DNS provider account. They can use different domain registrars.


### How to issue Wildcard certificates via Let's Encrypt?
Wild card certificates are not supported by Let's Encrypt as of Nov 2017. Wildcard certificates are [coming to LE in 2018](https://letsencrypt.org/2017/07/06/wildcard-certificates-coming-jan-2018.html). Once this is officially supported, we hope to integrate that in Voyager.

### Does Voyager support OCSP stapling?
Voyager currently does not issue certificates that use OCSP stapling. See [here](https://github.com/appscode/voyager/issues/531) for prior discussions.
